so todo :

find info 
format and write contents;

provide a view/template option to user ? [maybe later]

i think Q/A and help would best be suited with website

should this also keep track of [done, drafts, etc] (i mean like categories the solutions ?)

we need to have a config file to keep data (like name or other hardcoded info eg api key)
or better yet export data with a js module

should i add a default template options/variables file ?

should i add Promise based interface for async network requesting ?

instead of asking the user if he wants to overwrite we should add the -f flag and only
allow overwriting when -f flag is set and abort the operation in case already exists.

oh and also should config file really contain the user data like name ?
nope its fine

config will have langauge option and then that will be used to get description
I should probably also make a way to make the user fill out the info before use.

nested string objects in templating have been taken care of now arrays left i guess wait lemme experiment.
yup done. nice.

ok now implementing axios DONE
now i have to focus on writing the file. DONE

wow i think this tool is actually functional now!!

now i should work on a README.md and open source this!

should i warn the user if dataObj.languages does not contain his language of choice ? ya but later
ohh setting description is still left...

DAMN I CANT BELIEVE I CODED THE getDescription function wow.
but its not cross problem currently i guess.
nice.

oh also i still need to add languages support, hehe and improve the langauge identifying RegExp
try next on (https://www.codewars.com/kata/529adbf7533b761c560004e5/train/javascript)
oh looking at the generated file i guess we need the text-wrap thing here.

nice now also working on https://www.codewars.com/kata/529adbf7533b761c560004e5/train/javascript

aah cant use it like that https://github.com/$USERNAME

[intl]

methods (constructors) to search for
Intl.DateTimeFormat
Intl.Locale
Intl.RelativeTimeFormat

[bug]

ok -f not working
also new filenot being created
watch todo in index.js
i feel that finding size of file when we know it exist is a bit overkill is it ?

[nodejs && javascript]

whats up with UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning ?
code execution doesnt stop when we encounter it i guess

so whats export default vs module.exports = {}

learn typescript
static vs public methods
static methods can only be called on class and not on the instance of the class.
public methods can only be called on instance of the class and not on the class.
When a method is private it means it can only be accessed by objects OF THE SAME CLASS.
todo: learn typescript, css, sass, react, bundling, UI, UX and more js and oop in js

[OFF_TOPIC]

ok so ~ is equal to !! and casts to Boolean but why does ~9 return -10 ?
git clean -fdx , instead of rmdrf node_module ?


[code]
// get input
function getInput(msg) {
	return new Promise((resolve) => {
		rl.question(msg, function(ans) {
			rl.close();
			resolve(ans);
		});
	});
}
