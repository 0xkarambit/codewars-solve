so todo :

find info 
format and write contents;

provide a view/template option to user ? [maybe later]

i think Q/A and help would best be suited with website

should this also keep track of [done, drafts, etc] (i mean like categories the solutions ?)

we need to have a config file to keep data (like name or other hardcoded info eg api key)
or better yet export data with a js module

should i add a default template options/variables file ?

[intl]

methods (constructors) to search for
Intl.DateTimeFormat
Intl.Locale
Intl.RelativeTimeFormat

[bug]

ok -f not working
also new filenot being created
watch todo in index.js
i feel that finding size of file when we know it exist is a bit overkill is it ?

[nodejs]

whats up with UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning ?
code execution doesnt stop when we encounter it i guess

[OFF_TOPIC]

ok so ~ is equal to !! and casts to Boolean but why does ~9 return -10 ?
git clean -fdx , instead of rmdrf node_module ?


[code]
// get input
function getInput(msg) {
	return new Promise((resolve) => {
		rl.question(msg, function(ans) {
			rl.close();
			resolve(ans);
		});
	});
}
