> hmm why is run request made twice ?

### **authorise**

###### todo/ideas
* should i keep headers and response of requests in their own specific files ? 

_what am i rev-eng it for all of it must be in the [api-refernce](https://dev.codewars.com/#api-reference)_

## __headers encountered__

(a lot of these requests have cloud fare ids/hashes attached in their headers)
(i dont know if these are absolutely essential for making a successful request or not)

* cr-ray (deprecated now, but both appeared in network tab)
* cr-request-id

A unique request ID generated by Cloudflare. Cloudflare's customer support can use this identifier to trace a request through its network.
OBS: both headers same on every request.
note: oh both of these are response headers

[source](https://dri.es/headers?url=https://dri.es)
[How does Cloudflare handle HTTP Request headers?](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170986-How-does-Cloudflare-handle-HTTP-Request-headers-)

i need to filter out the cloudflare headers 

bring all cookies (except google analytics ? or should i bring them too) in a file to
find and see which one are passed with requests headers and which one are received.
